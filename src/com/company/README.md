# General info
This is a simple tictactoe game. It allows you to play in different modes, against human or ai.

# Setup
First write command 'start' along with game parameters. Here is a full list of them:
- user easy / easy user
- medium user / user medium
- hard user
- medium medium
- medium easy
- easy medium

First command is type of player that starts the game, second one is the second player. 'AI' have three different difficulities (easy, medium, hard). The least one
utilises the minimax algorithm to find the most optimal move so is's the unbeatable one.

# Play
After typing starting command the game requires player (if there is a human one) to type the two separated by spacebar parameters of the move.
First one is the {1,3} on y axis and the second one is {1,3} on x axis, like that: 1 3. After player makes a move there's an ai move which is displayed on the board
in the command line. The game goes on until someone wins. Command 'exit' exits the program.
